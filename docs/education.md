Univeristy of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark

September 2019 - June 2021

Completed the M.Sc. in engineering in robot systems at SDU with specialization in advanced robotics technology and
gained experience in advanced robot control, advanced computer vision, mechanical engineering, tools of artiﬁcial
intelligence, optimization and control, multivariate statistics, etc. I have a weighted grade point average of 11.33.

## Master Thesis - Generating 2D Data for Pose Estimation of Rigid Objects with Neural Networks

[Scape Technology A/S](https://www.scapetechnologies.com/)

September 2020 - June 2021

My master thesis was in collaboration with Scape Technology A/S and focused on generating 2D data for pose esti-
mation of rigid objects with neural networks, thus, removing the need for time-consuming hand-labeling of data.
